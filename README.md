RGB VN-Solver
In the VN-Solver RGB folder, we have the code for generating figures from adjacency matrixes in generate_figure.py where the uniform configuration is used (nodes are red, edges are black). We introduced ellipse layout in layout.py which should be replaced by the layout.py in networkx package. Primarily, the size of the node circle is 
0.5
 and the thickness of the edge segment is 
0.1
. Further, we set different values for node_size and edge_width. After generating figures, we train 5 ResNet models using 3, 7, 11, 13, 29 as seeds to split the data. The random seed of the model is 23 and the models are trained on 2 GPUs. As we have datasets with 3 different sizes, we defined a tv variable to indicate the size of the training set and validation set. The test_on_best.py evaluates the model with the highest F1 score on the test set while the test_on_epochs.py evaluate models saved in each epoch against the test set. Evaluation of each epoch is further used to draw Figure 3 in the manuscript. The code to generate this figure is available in draw_figures_in_manuscript.py. After evaluating the best model on the test set, we aggregate the results of the seeds to have the final result. This is done in aggregate_seed.py.
